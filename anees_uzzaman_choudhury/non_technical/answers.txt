1. How do you stay updated on software development topics and remain active in the community? (Forums/Discord/Slack/Meetups/Twitter/Blogs)
-> My main source to stay in touch with the tech community is through discord where I have joined a lot of channels such as coding cohorts and channels like Scrimba, Boot.dev.
I also follow developer related youtubers such as Fireship and Primeagen

2. What are your most-used IDE and keyboard shortcuts when coding?
-> Other than Ctrl C, V and X, I use Ctrl D to select same words, Ctrl + Shift + L can be used to select occurences of a word. 
Ctrl End and Ctrl Home as well

3. How do you approach the design and implementation of a scalable backend system? Feel free to attach code snippets for better explanation.
-> I like think in terms of most important requirements first and scale later although scaling stays in my mind.
Then I like do the database design and make the api endpoints, that's half the job done. But I still might have to go back and 
forth between the frontend and backend to make adjustments. Once I have an product I like think about optimizing it as much as possible and scale
the system, wether through load balancing, rate limiting, message queues, pub subs or caching or some other strategy 

4. How do you ensure that your frontend code is functional and reliable? What are your favorite testing methods and tools?
-> I ensure I have clear skeleton, components and endpoints to begin with and that helps. I do use Jest for testing. 
For testing I like to do as much manual testing as possible. I also check the perfomance with webvitals or other benchmarks.
